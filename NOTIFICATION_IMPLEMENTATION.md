# Web Push Notification Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Was Implemented

I've successfully implemented a comprehensive web push notification system for your Murder Mystery game. Here's what was added:

### 1. Server-Side (Backend)

**File: `server/index.mjs`**
- ✅ Imported and configured `web-push` library with VAPID keys
- ✅ Added `/api/vapid-public-key` endpoint to get public key for client
- ✅ Added `/api/push/subscribe` endpoint to save player subscriptions
- ✅ Added `/api/push/unsubscribe` endpoint to remove subscriptions
- ✅ **Added `/api/gm/notify` endpoint** - Main route for GMs to send notifications
- ✅ Loaded `push_subscriptions.json` for storing subscription data
- ✅ Automatic cleanup of expired/invalid subscriptions

**New Data File: `server/data/push_subscriptions.json`**
- Stores player push notification subscriptions
- Contains player ID, name, subscription object, and timestamp

### 2. Service Worker

**File: `public/sw.js`**
- ✅ Handles incoming push notifications from server
- ✅ Displays notifications to users
- ✅ Handles notification clicks (opens/focuses app)
- ✅ Includes vibration patterns for better UX

### 3. Frontend Utilities

**File: `src/utils/notificationManager.js`**
- ✅ Complete notification management utility class
- ✅ Browser support detection
- ✅ Permission request handling
- ✅ Service worker registration
- ✅ Subscribe/unsubscribe functionality
- ✅ Test notification feature

### 4. Authentication Integration

**File: `src/components/AuthWrapper.jsx`**
- ✅ Automatic push notification subscription on sign-in
- ✅ Automatic unsubscription on sign-out
- ✅ Permission status tracking
- ✅ Non-intrusive notification prompts

### 5. Admin Interface

**File: `src/pages/Admin.jsx`**
- ✅ **New notification panel** at top of admin page
- ✅ Compose notification with title and body
- ✅ Select specific players or send to all
- ✅ Optional URL for notification clicks
- ✅ Success/error feedback with detailed results
- ✅ Shows number of successful/failed sends

### 6. User Notifications Page

**File: `src/pages/Notifications.jsx`**
- ✅ Complete notification management interface
- ✅ Shows browser support status
- ✅ Shows permission status
- ✅ Shows subscription status
- ✅ Enable/disable notifications
- ✅ Test notification button
- ✅ Helpful instructions for fixing denied permissions

### 7. Routing

**File: `src/main.jsx`**
- ✅ Added `/notifications` route for both signed-in paths

### 8. Documentation

**Files: `NOTIFICATIONS.md` and `test-notifications.mjs`**
- ✅ Complete documentation of the notification system
- ✅ Usage instructions for players and GMs
- ✅ API examples and troubleshooting guide
- ✅ Test script to verify configuration

## 🎯 How to Use

### For Game Masters (GMs):

1. **Go to Admin Page**: Navigate to `/gm`
2. **Find Notification Panel**: Look for "📢 Send Push Notifications" section at the top
3. **Compose Message**:
   - Enter notification title (e.g., "New Clue Found!")
   - Enter notification body (e.g., "Check the library...")
   - Optional: Set URL (e.g., `/nfc/blue4`)
   - Optional: Select specific players (or leave empty for all)
4. **Send**: Click "📢 Send Notification"
5. **View Results**: See how many notifications were sent successfully

### For Players:

1. **Sign In**: Automatic prompt to enable notifications
2. **Receive Notifications**: Get notified even when browser is closed
3. **Manage**: Visit `/notifications` to enable/disable or test

### Testing:

```bash
# Run test script to verify configuration
node test-notifications.mjs

# Or test from command line:
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/gm/notify \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Test Notification",
    "body": "This is a test!",
    "url": "/"
  }'
```

## 🔑 Key Features

✅ **Notifications work when page is closed** - Uses Web Push API
✅ **Automatic subscription** - Players are subscribed on sign-in
✅ **Selective targeting** - Send to all or specific players
✅ **Persistent** - Subscriptions saved server-side
✅ **Graceful degradation** - Works on supported browsers, doesn't break on unsupported
✅ **User control** - Players can enable/disable at `/notifications`
✅ **Admin feedback** - GMs see success/failure results
✅ **Auto-cleanup** - Invalid subscriptions automatically removed

## 📱 Browser Support

- ✅ Chrome/Edge 50+
- ✅ Firefox 44+
- ✅ Safari 16+ (macOS 13+, iOS 16.4+)
- ✅ Opera 39+
- ❌ IE (not supported, but won't break)

## 🔐 Security Notes

- VAPID keys are used for authentication
- Requires user permission (can't send without consent)
- No sensitive data in notifications (use generic messages)
- Expired subscriptions auto-removed

## 📂 New Files Created

1. `server/data/push_subscriptions.json` - Stores subscriptions
2. `public/sw.js` - Service worker for push handling
3. `src/utils/notificationManager.js` - Frontend utility
4. `src/pages/Notifications.jsx` - User management page
5. `NOTIFICATIONS.md` - Complete documentation
6. `test-notifications.mjs` - Test script

## 🔄 Modified Files

1. `server/index.mjs` - Added push notification endpoints
2. `src/components/AuthWrapper.jsx` - Added auto-subscription
3. `src/pages/Admin.jsx` - Added notification sending UI
4. `src/main.jsx` - Added /notifications route

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Start the server**: The notification system is ready to use
2. **Sign in as a player**: Test automatic subscription
3. **Visit `/gm` as admin**: Try sending a notification
4. **Visit `/notifications`**: Check subscription status

## 📝 Example Notification Flow

1. Player signs in → Automatic subscription prompt → Granted
2. GM composes notification on `/gm` page
3. GM selects target players (or all)
4. GM clicks "Send Notification"
5. Backend sends push notification via web-push
6. Service worker receives push event
7. Browser displays notification (even if tab closed)
8. Player clicks notification → App opens/focuses

## 🎉 Ready to Test!

Your notification system is fully implemented and ready to use. Start your development server and test it out!

```bash
npm start
```

Then:
1. Sign in as a player
2. Open another tab/window for GM dashboard (`/gm`)
3. Send a notification to yourself
4. See the notification appear even if you close the player tab!
